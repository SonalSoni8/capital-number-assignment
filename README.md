React JS Assignment

Here is the deployed link: https://capital-number-assignment-git-main-sonal-sonis-projects.vercel.app/

The developed version is completely responsive.

- Created my own OMDB API keys and implemented them accordingly
But there was limited access to the object data, I was getting this data:

{Poster: "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjdhOGY1OTktYWJkZC00OGY5LWJhY2QtZmQzZDA2MzY5MmNmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDk3NzU2MTQ@._V1_SX300.jpg"
Title: "Last Action Hero"
Type: "movie"
Year: "1993"
imdbID: "tt0107362"}

many data like imbdrating, runtime, description, etc aren't available so for now I have added static data.

- I have used NextJS $ Tailwind CSS for UI design.

- Created Debounce function for Search.
